                <p>
                    Hello, nice to meet you, I'm Isaac Vitor! I have 18 years old, working with administration, moderation and websites development [with HTML, CSS & JavaScript]. I already have work before with some companies and games, including: GVERSE INTERNATIONAL PTE. LTD. [specifically in the Official Blockman Go Discord Server as an Language Master], Vizta Games [on Mobile Party & Mob Rush, as an Administrator, Moderator etc.], Spectrum Team [in the Spectrum, as an Official {the highest position}, Administrator etc.] and Moonton [for Mob Rush & Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, as an Administrator and Moderator].

                <h3>Informations</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a resident located in Brazil and was born in that country, I am attending high school [2024] in the 3rd year. I know a lot about writing in English [high level] and I use this knowledge to work with games and companies whose communities are globalized, requiring the use of this language. Currently, I am improving and applying my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, specifically in web development. I intend to start my own application and game projects in a few months, or from a year onwards, depending on the flow and need for training time to apply studies and learning.
